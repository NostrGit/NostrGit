# NostrGit

A truly censorship-resistant alternative to GitHub that has a chance of working.

Read about the vision [here](https://github.com/NostrGit/NostrGit/tree/main/documentation/vision.md).

# How to run locally (production)

## Docker container git-nostr-bridge

Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
These instructions assume you are not running openSSH Server on port 22 on your machine.

```bash
# clone the NostrGit repository
$ git clone https://github.com/NostrGit/NostrGit.git
```

Edit the `gitnostr/Dockerfile`
  - replace the public key (hex) with your public key (hex) in the "gitRepoOwners" section of the JSON
  - optional: add/remove some relays in the "relays" section of the JSON

```bash
# change the directory to NostrGit
$ cd NostrGit
# run the git-nostr-bridge container
$ docker compose up > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

## git-nostr-cli

To run the cli tool for managing git repositories over nostr:

Make sure you have go installed
```bash
$ go version
```

If the command above doesnt print out something like 

`go version go1.20.2 linux/amd64`, 

you can follow [these instructions](https://go.dev/doc/install) to install go on your system.

```bash
# change directory to gitnostr
$ cd ../gitnostr/
# compile the cli tool (requires go installation)
$ make git-nostr-cli
# Run the git-nostr-cli command once to create the default config file
$ ./bin/gn
```

You should get the message `no relays connected`.

Edit the config file at `~/.config/git-nostr/git-nostr-cli.json`. The file should look something like this

```JSON
{
    "relays": ["wss://relay.damus.io", "wss://nostr.fmt.wiz.biz", "wss://nos.lol"],
    "privateKey": "", // your nostr private key (hex)
    "gitSshBase": "root@localhost" // the docker containers expect this
}
```

You need to publish your public ssh key to the nostr relays to be able to interact with the git-nostr-bridge docker container.
You may need to replace id_rsa.pub with the correct public key file.

```bash
./bin/gn ssh-key add ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Create repository and clone it. Replace `<publickey>` with the hex representation of your public key. If you are using a nip05 capable public key you can use the nip05 identifier instead.

```bash
$ ./bin/gn repo create <repo_name>
$ ./bin/gn repo clone  <publickey>:<repo_name>
```

To be able to push to the repository you can set write permission with the following command.

```bash
# public key must be in the hex format
$ ./bin/gn repo permission <repo_name> <publickey> WRITE
```

If you are using a nip05 capable public key you can use the nip05 identifier instead.

```bash
$ ./bin/gn repo permission username@relayaddr WRITE
```

# Development

Fork the repo

```bash
# install yarn packages
$ yarn
# run in development mode (localhost:3000)
$ yarn dev
```
